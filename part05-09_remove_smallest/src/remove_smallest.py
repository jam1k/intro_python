# Please write a function named remove_smallest(numbers: list), which takes a list of integers as its argument.
# The functions should find and remove the smallest item in the list. You may assume there is a single smallest item in the list.
# The function should not have a return value - it should directly modify the list it receives as a parameter.
# Write your solution here

def remove_smallest(numbers: list):
    numbers.remove(min(numbers))
